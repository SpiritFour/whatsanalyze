12/16/20, 18:10 - Jane Doe: sand is sold out. The other two as medium size and SLIM in the shopping cart.
I will think about it until tonight

12/16/20, 21:03 - Jane Doe: so shipping cost depends on the quantity you order. Are 20$ at 100$ and 35$ at 300$, or at least per item. So it's the same if we order separately, but everyone gets a hammock.
