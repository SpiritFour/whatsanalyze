10/28/20, 15:05 - Paul: hmm if I'm honest, so half exciting. So schaus me every week briefly, but am not yet really convinced of the format. But that could also be because I'm just not that interested in it.
10/28/20, 15:05 - Paul: sorry
10/28/20, 15:07 - Moritz Wolf: haha, thanks for the honesty

10/28/20, 15:10 - Paul: yes since Saturday
10/28/20, 15:10 - Paul: and think it's already smarter to get tested there
10/28/20, 15:10 - Moritz Wolf: ah damn, yes
10/28/20, 15:11 - Moritz Wolf: well then I hope that you don't have it

10/28/20, 15:11 - Moritz Wolf: soon
10/28/20, 15:11 - Paul: yes, but wouldn't be the end of the world if

10/28/20, 15:11 - Paul: and Rome was really beautiful
10/28/20, 15:11 - Paul: before that was still there

12/9/20, 14:47 - Paul: You're back in Germany, aren't you?
12/9/20, 14:47 - Moritz Wolf: Photos?

12/9/20, 14:52 - Paul: https://alexanderpeiniger.com/how-i-design-my-morning-routine-to-achieve-my-goals-ceb004b6bc35
Something like that could also be in the blog, if you test it yourself or something
12/9/20, 14:52 - Moritz Wolf: https://www.google.de/search?q=thai+ha+ha+translator&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-de&client=safari

12/9/20, 14:53 - Paul: Read this one
12/9/20, 14:53 - Moritz Wolf: That's exactly why I stopped reading it haha
12/9/20, 14:53 - Moritz Wolf: I already read that one
12/9/20, 14:54 - Paul: Maybe also exciting for the blog
12/9/20, 14:54 - Moritz Wolf: But hard to say, there are already blatant claims inside. Only there are always paper that say the opposite.
12/9/20, 14:55 - Moritz Wolf: I got a blog post from bene that examined the gaussian distribution of the papers.
12/9/20, 14:55 - Moritz Wolf: But I can't find it anymore, it was really good.
12/9/20, 14:58 - Moritz Wolf: What else are you doing besides your master thesis?
12/9/20, 14:59 - Moritz Wolf: Yes, I think so.
12/9/20, 15:00 - Moritz Wolf: I also have a very cool system how I make notes that I put up there I think

12/16/20, 17:36 - Moritz Wolf: they are also available as menswear
12/16/20, 17:36 - Moritz Wolf: if you order something there maybe you can order something for me :P from 100usd there is still a free hammock
12/16/20, 17:37 - Paul: what do you need?
12/16/20, 17:38 - Paul: can i do it already?
12/16/20, 17:40 - Moritz Wolf: <media omitted>
12/16/20, 17:40 - Moritz Wolf: oh i can also order myself
12/16/20, 17:40 - Moritz Wolf: black, olive and sand colors
12/16/20, 17:40 - Moritz Wolf: I already have them in blue
12/16/20, 17:41 - Moritz Wolf: wait I have to think about it first
12/16/20, 17:41 - Moritz Wolf: you just order first
12/16/20, 17:42 - Moritz Wolf: shipping is 15usd
12/16/20, 17:44 - Moritz Wolf: ah they even have a eu store
12/16/20, 17:45 - Paul: but more expensive
12/16/20, 17:45 - Paul: and no free hammock
12/16/20, 17:45 - Moritz Wolf: yes
12/16/20, 17:45 - Moritz Wolf: the eu store is not worth it
12/16/20, 17:48 - Paul: is 20‚Ç¨ shipping
12/16/20, 17:48 - Paul: dollar
12/16/20, 17:48 - Moritz Wolf: yes it depends on what you order i think
12/16/20, 17:48 - Moritz Wolf: order them with me then we share shipping
12/16/20, 17:48 - Moritz Wolf: when you order something
12/16/20, 17:49 - Moritz Wolf: the pants are end nice, I'm wearing the blue one right now
12/16/20, 17:49 - Moritz Wolf: then you also have two hammlocks
12/16/20, 17:49 - Moritz Wolf: https://coalatree.com/collections/hammocks/products/tree-hugger-hammock-straps
something like that is also not wrong, you can get it at amazon but something like this
12/16/20, 17:50 - Moritz Wolf: i can do some knots now, but if you do it with normal ropes you have to practice a bit and don't forget it
12/16/20, 18:10 - Paul: sand is sold out. The other two as medium size and SLIM in the shopping cart.
I will think about it until tonight
12/16/20, 18:10 - Moritz Wolf: ok
12/16/20, 18:10 - Paul: let you know if I book again
12/16/20, 18:10 - Paul: thanks in any case
12/16/20, 18:10 - Moritz Wolf: jo super
12/16/20, 18:12 - Moritz Wolf: then I take the sand in regular in S^^
12/16/20, 21:03 - Paul: so shipping cost depends on the quantity you order. Are 20$ at 100$ and 35$ at 300$, or at least per item. So it's the same if we order separately, but everyone gets a hammock.
12/16/20, 23:42 - Moritz Wolf: Ok
12/23/20, 16:11 - Moritz Wolf: <media omitted>
